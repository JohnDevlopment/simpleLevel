A game I'm developing, titled Project Dewpsi.

To execute this game in Linux, just go to the main directory and type in `make` on the commandline. Then type `./execute.sh` on the commandline to start up the game. Right now the only thing you can do is move the character left and right and interact with a few tiles.

The game requires these libraries to compile:
  * SDL2
  * SDL2_image
  * SDL2_mixer
  * SDL2_ttf
